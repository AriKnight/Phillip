# notAiess [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/notaiess/badge/?version=latest)](https://notaiess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
A Discord webhook for nomination feeds.

## Why?
Because afaik, there are no open-source nomination feed for osu! We've seen Aiess and CPOL's nomination feed, but none of them are actually open sourced, therefore I'm here to bring the feed to the open source community!

## How do we run it?
It's simple! Way too simple, really.
1. Copy your Discord webhook url. [This URL should be clear enough for you.](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
2. Get osu! API key. [You can get it here.](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api)
3. Run the hook from command line :D
   ```
   python3 run.py <osu! token> <webhook url>
   ```
There is no loggging atm, but will do soon.

## Contributing
Contribution is always welcome (obviously)! You can create a fork, do your changes and create a pull request to improve my shitty code or add one or two features!
